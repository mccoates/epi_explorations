# Comparison of Methods for Analyzing RCT Data Regarding Baseline Treatment Group Differences

Motivation: Reading Twisk (2018) and:

-   Seeing multiple approaches for analyzing fairly basic structures of RCT data
-   Reading about regression to the mean and Wanting to understand how different methods for analyzing RCT data do or do not handle this well
-   Wanting to grapple with augmented DAG structures that illustrate the "difference in differences" and "longitudinal analysis of covariance" approaches

## Models Examined




When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
